Solidarity stands for “caring with” and a community mindset in people, translated into systems. On a systemic level, it means that the technological ecosystem makes and accepts cooperation as the path of least resistance. On a human level it means that cooperation is the chosen path.

### Quick version

- **Give every agent a civic ID, not a dossier:** Meronymity (partial anonymity) proves tethering without doxxing.
- **Make departure cheap:** Social portability: number portability for networks.
- **Reward bridges by default:** Platform metrics and audits center relational health.

### Results we want

- People, organizations, and AIs operate under explicit, machine‑checkable norms.
- Decentralized defense (federated trust & safety) is stronger than any single gatekeeper.
- Ecosystem incentives favor bridge‑making over enragement.

## Why Solidarity?

Even perfect, civic local practice fails in a hostile wider ecosystem. Solidarity equips the whole field so good systemic behavior wins by design. A community mindset amongst people will support relational health.

A simple picture:Traffic is safer not because each driver is a saint, but because roads, signs, and rules make safe driving easier than reckless driving.

## Simple ideas behind this chapter

- **Identity without exposure.** Agent IDs assert “this agent is anchored to a human/legal entity” without revealing the person publicly.
- **Interoperability beats captivity.** Portability and open protocols move competition to quality of care.
- **Federation over monoliths.** Share threat intelligence without a single chokepoint.
- **Auditability of amplification.** **Expression ≠ amplification**; recommender accountability is a civic duty.

## What good solidarity looks like

- **Agent ID registry (meronymity).** Agents (human/org/AI) have attestations (KYC/KYB) held by trusted custodians; public proofs are minimal but verifiable.
- **Social portability.** Users export their social graph and content in standard formats (ActivityPub/AT‑like), pass interoperability tests, and keep their audience when they leave.
- **Bridging transparency.** Platforms publish bridge indices, cross‑group endorsement scores, and “trust‑under‑loss” audits.
- **Federated Trust & Safety.** Networks share textual threat intel and embedding **fingerprints** through an open consortium so local policies stay local while defense compounds.
- **Protocol‑level norms.** Machine‑readable terms of cooperation (e.g., no scraping without consent; honor appeal webhooks; respect exit).

## From ideas to everyday practice (step by step)

1. **Stand up an Agent ID custodian.** Community orgs or public interest entities issue/hold attestations; publish revocation and challenge endpoints.
2. **Mandate portability in procurement.** Public buyers require protocol interop and **exit‑with‑trust** drills.
3. **Adopt bridge audits.** Platforms publish their relational health metrics quarterly; third parties verify.
4. **Join a safety federation.** Contribute to and consume from a shared threat registry; localize enforcement.
5. **Default to bridge feeds.** Make bridging‑based ranking the default feed for civic contexts.

## Plain tools (buildable today)

- **Agent ID schema** (DIDs/VCs, revocation lists, proof formats).
- **Portability harness** (export/import scripts; fidelity checks).
- **Bridge audit kit** (compute and publish overlap metrics).
- **Federated T\&S hub** (open APIs for threat intel; local adapters).
- **Terms‑as‑code** (policy schemas agents can check automatically).

## Flood‑bot story - Part V: caring with others

- **Agent IDs.** Volunteer translators and the flood‑bot register with meronymous IDs; abuse drops; accountability rises without exposing private info.
- **Portability.** Survivors move their case files and contacts from the emergency bot to long‑term housing services without re‑entering everything.
- **Federated defense.** Scam reports from neighboring cities flow in via the safety hub; the bot downgrades suspect links by default.
- **Bridge metrics.** Weekly public bridge index shows renters and homeowners co‑endorsing more proposals than week one.

## What could go wrong (and quick fixes)

- **ID creep.** IDs become dossiers. **Fix:** Meronymity by design; minimal proofs; independent custodians; strong revocation.
- **Portability theatre.** Exports are unreadable or lossy. **Fix:** Exit tests in contracts; penalties for fidelity failure.
- **Federation capture.** One big player dictates norms. **Fix:** Polycentric governance; open standards; rotating stewards.

## How we keep ourselves honest (what we measure)

- **Portability fidelity** - lossless export/import rate.
- **Abuse resolution time** across the federation.
- **Bridge index trend** by cohort.
- **Exit‑with‑trust** satisfaction.

## Interfaces with other packs

- From **Responsiveness:** repair culture feeds trust across organisations.
- To **Symbiosis:** solidarity provides the treaties local kami need to cooperate.

## A closing image:

Imagine a well‑marked interchange—many lanes, clear signs, safe merges—where travel is smoother because the road is built for sharing.

A bridge isn't competent because the blueprint is elegant, but because the bridge holds — and continues to hold when trucks cross, winds rise, and inspectors check the bolts.

Tronto insists that "assuming responsibility is not yet the same as doing the actual work of care." Competence is about execution: working code that does what it promised, audited, explainable, and safe-to-fail. And crucially: "to be competent to care is not simply a technical issue, but a moral one." A system that ships broken care with good intentions has failed morally, not just technically.

The illustration's framing: _We check the process_ — not "just trust us," but with transparency and fast community feedback on how care is delivered.

### Core ideas

- **Safety is a property of practice.** Competence is demonstrated in operation, not assumed from design.
- **Proof before promotion.** Features graduate only after shadowing → canary → general with guardrails.
- **Observability over opaqueness.** A "show your work" approach with traces, datasets, and explainable summaries tied to decisions promotes observability. (Observability means the system's reasoning is inspectable, not that the operator sees individual private interactions.)
- **Least power.** The simplest mechanism is used to meet the need; complexity grows attack surface.
- **Bridging-based ranking.** Recommenders score content and agent actions by how well they bridge coherent clusters, not outrage them.

### What good competence looks like

- **Graduated release.** New policies run in shadow mode, then canary for a random representative slice, then general rollout with rollback primed.
- **Decision traces.** Every denial, recommendation, or escalation has a trace: which rule, which sources, uncertainty score, and a receipt link.
- **Guardrails as code.** Rights and red lines expressed as machine-checkable rules (deny-by-default when ambiguous).
- **Security as competence.** An agent with filesystem or network access runs in a strict sandbox with least-privilege permissions, validated inputs, and no implicit trust of upstream content.
    - Prompt injection, privilege escalation, and lateral movement are competence failures — moral responsibilities of those who build and deploy these systems, not mere technical oversights.
- **Data minimalism.** Only what the remedy needs is collected; delete on handoff; consent honoured at every stage.
- **Reproducible builds.** Configs are versioned; one-click replays re-create results.

### From ideas to practice

1. **Derive specs from contracts.** Convert Pack 2 engagement contracts into acceptance tests.
2. **Instrument for observability.** Emit decision traces with links to sources and receipts (from Pack 1).
3. **Run shadow mode.** New policy sees inputs and proposes actions but doesn't act. Compare to human/previous system.
4. **Canary safely.** Release to a small, representative group with automatic rollback if drift exceeds bounds.
5. **Audit before general.** Conduct independent audit of evals, logs, and guardrails; publish attested report.
6. **Generalize & monitor.** Enable for all; watch drift monitors; keep pause wired.
7. **Post-incident learning.** Maintain blameless reviews; fixes become tests.

### Tools (buildable today)

- **Bridge score functions.** PCA/embedding-based overlap metrics.
- **Shadow/canary orchestrator** with rollback switches.
- **Decision trace schema.** Inputs, rules fired, sources, uncertainties.
- **Guardrail engine.** Policy-as-code for rights/consents.
- **Drift monitors.** Data, performance, fairness.
- **Eval registry.** Versioned tests; provenance; localized packs.

### Flood-bot story: Part III

- **Bridge ranking.** When multiple aid channels exist, the bot's recommender prioritises actions that increase cross-neighbourhood endorsement. For example: renters want rapid cash for lost wages, while homeowners want property-damage payouts. The bot surfaces a bridging proposal — pooling funds for rapid municipal mould remediation and debris clearing, protecting both the renter's lungs and the owner's equity. Both groups endorse the proposal.
- **Shadow → canary.** A new "medical receipts waiver" runs in shadow for a week; then canaries to 10% of livelihood claims; rollback bound: appeals >15%.
- **Observability.** Every denial has a trace: which rule, which sources, uncertainty score, and a receipt link for the claimant.

### What could go wrong

- **Gaming the bridge.** Actors craft messages to look "bridging." Fix: Mix human audits; require durable cross-group endorsement over time.
- **Train/test leakage.** Evals look good; reality fails. Fix: Hold-out datasets, randomized spot checks, live A/Bs with rollback.
- **Opaque "black box."** "Trust us" explanations. Fix: Traceable summaries + public examples; auditors can reconstruct decisions.
- **Canary bias.** Canary slice is unrepresentative. Fix: Stratify sampling; publish canary demographics.

### Interfaces with other packs

- **From Responsibility (Pack 2):** specs, SLAs, brakes.
- **To Responsiveness (Pack 4):** competence delivers; responsiveness checks whether it worked. Incident loops and eval results feed Pack 4.
- **To Solidarity (Pack 5):** bridge scores computed here supply the bridge index published by Pack 5.
- **To Symbiosis (Pack 6):** competence proves an agent is ready to stay local.

### A closing image: the bridge with inspection tags

Imagine a well-kept bridge with inspection tags — date, load test, next check — visible to anyone crossing. Competence is not the absence of failure; it is the presence of proof that someone checked, and will check again.

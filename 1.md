At a crosswalk, drivers slow for a child. No one stops to solve an equation. A need appears; a duty follows. That's attentiveness.

Now scale up. An AI looks at a world full of "crosswalks" — workers, rivers, languages, customs. Within that world, AI can treat each as an obstacle or as a relationship asking for care. The difference begins with the first look.

Joan Tronto calls attentiveness "a suspension of one's self-interest, and a capacity genuinely to look from the perspective of the one in need." The opposite is what she names _privileged irresponsibility_: the luxury of not noticing. According to Tronto, "One of the great benefits of being in a position of superiority is that one need not exert conscious effort in maintaining that system. Such privileged irresponsibility usually takes the form of complete ignorance of a problem." Attentiveness is the discipline of refusing that luxury.

Design primitives — broad listening, bridging maps, perspective receipts — create conditions for that discipline, but the moral attention they make possible still requires human judgment that no procedure can replace.

### Core ideas of attentiveness

- **Relationships first.** The relationship is the basic unit of care. Some situations make duties visible because of roles and dependencies. Listening means providing secure channels for voluntary input, not passive surveillance.
- **Power must answer questions.** Decisions should be explainable and challengeable. If no one can question you, the process isn't fair.
- **Be precise only when it helps.** Start with stories and people. Add numbers when they clarify; update them when reality changes.
- **Rights baseline.** We use the Universal Declaration of Human Rights plus local constitutional rights because care ethics only functions as a political ideal within liberal, pluralistic, democratic institutions. Rights are not opposed to care; they are the precondition for relational participation.
    - If someone's basic existence is being erased, they cannot participate in a bridging process. Claims that try to erase someone's standing are recorded but do not set the agenda.

### Why attentiveness matters for governance alignment

Many AI plans try to "learn the objective" from old data. But shared goals are bargains among changing lives. When people who were ignored finally speak, the target moves. Guessing a perfect, fixed goal fails.

Attentiveness offers another route: alignment to a trusted process that listens, explains, adapts, and can be corrected. Summaries show their sources. Unknowns are explicit. Standing invitations to revise remain open when new voices appear.

Rule of thumb: _Bridge first, decide second._ For acute harms (life-safety, livelihood), default to reversible protection immediately while bridging proceeds in parallel.

### What good attentiveness looks like

- **Look for absences.** "We heard nothing from night-shift carers — go find them." Missing voices are data. Hélène Landemore calls this the test of a "jolly hostess": not keeping the door open, but bringing the shy people out.
- **Show your work.** Every summary links to sources and marks disagreements.
- **Share attention fairly.** Don't just follow the loudest. Give time to those most affected. Favour smaller, coherent clusters — they're harder to bridge to and earn a higher bridging bonus.
- **Read the cleavage structure.** When mapping disagreements, note whether divisions are reinforcing — the same groups opposing each other across every issue — or cross-cutting, where opponents on one question are allies on another. The bridging map's job is to surface those cross-cutting people and connect them; reinforcing cleavages that have no cross-cutting are the higher-risk zones requiring more careful attention.
- **Build in repair.** Sunset clauses, review points, reversible defaults, and the humility to shut down or hand off.

### From ideas to practice

1. **Listen widely.** Take input by voice, text, and simple forms. Keep original language next to translations. Offer offline and accessible options.
2. **Map the views.** Make a bridging map that shows where people agree, where they clash, and why — without forcing a fake average.
3. **Send receipts.** Tell contributors where their words appear. Let contributors correct mistakes.
4. **Set a fair queue.** Spend more time where harm is high and voices are quiet. Make the rules public.
5. **Decide with brakes.** Require the map, the receipts, and an oversight check before big changes ship.

### Tools (buildable today)

- **Broad listening.** Multi-language, multi-channel input with source and uncertainty kept intact.
- **Bridging maps.** Charts of overlap and disagreement, with citations.
- **Perspective receipts.** Receipts that allow each person to find and correct how they were represented.
- **Machine-checkable rules.** Community data rules written to ensure software can enforce them automatically.
- **Fair queues.** Simple algorithms that favour high-risk issues and quiet voices.

### Flood-bot story

A midsize city is hit by floods. The city launches a simple chatbot — the flood-bot — to help people apply for emergency cash.

- **Listening.** People send voice notes, texts, or visit a kiosk. Messages stay in the original language, with a clear translation beside them. Elena, a night-shift hospital worker whose paper lease was destroyed in the flood, leaves a voice note in her first language explaining that she has no way to prove where she lived.
- **Mapping.** The team sorts needs into categories: housing, wage loss, medical care. They keep disagreements visible — renters and homeowners need different proofs.
- **Receipts.** Every contributor gets a link to see how their words were used and a button to say "that's not what I meant."
- **Fair queue.** Extra review time for medically fragile people and areas with poor connectivity.
- **Measure.** A public dashboard shows those reached and the fairness of the queue.

### What could go wrong

- **One metric runs the show.** Engagement is up, but trust is down. Fix: Use a small set of balanced measures and rotate them.
- **Listening theatre.** Glossy reports, same outcomes. Fix: Real decision gates, outside veto power, and spot checks.
- **Loud voices take over.** Well-funded groups flood the channel. Fix: Throttles, fair quotas, public attention dashboards.
- **First movers freeze the frame.** Early language locks in. Fix: Rolling windows and boosts for late but important views.
- **False balance.** Treating harmful claims as equal. Fix: Separate facts from values, uphold basic rights, refuse fake equivalence.
- **Fake crowds.** Copy-paste comments. Fix: Source checks and rate limits.
- **Capture by power.** Oversight migrates toward those with most to lose from scrutiny. Fix: Keep oversight independent, rulings public, funding transparent.
- **Procedural capture.** Process professionals learn the format; resourced orgs dominate the queue. Fix: Fund participation — paid time, childcare, translation, community intermediaries — and track who is missing, not just who shows up.

### Interfaces with other packs

- **From Responsiveness (Pack 4):** repair loops and newly discovered needs restart the cycle.
- **From Symbiosis (Pack 6):** retired agents gift maps, evals, and receipts, offering a better baseline for the next first look.
- **To Responsibility (Pack 2):** attentiveness hands over the who, what, and why — along with flags on rights and unknowns.
- **To Competence (Pack 3):** high-caution areas become small, safe-to-fail trials.
- **To Solidarity (Pack 5):** fair attention and open challenge build cross-group trust.
- **To Symbiosis (Pack 6):** The system serves a place and time, and treats shutdown as success.

### A closing image: the jolly hostess who can still say no

Picture a jolly hostess who welcomes each guest by name, makes space for their baggage — but who also moves through the room to find the person standing alone by the wall and asks the question only they can answer. That's attentiveness. And because some guests try to erase others, the hostess keeps a firm rule: hospitality within a rights-respecting home. Teach our systems to be jolly hosts — attentive, not prematurely optimising — and we will keep more of what's precious and create more that's shareable.

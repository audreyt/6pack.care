At a crosswalk, drivers slow for a child. No one stops to solve an equation. A need appears; a duty follows. That is attentiveness.

Now scale up. An AI looks at a world full of "crosswalks" — workers, rivers, languages, customs. It can treat them as obstacles or as relationships asking for care. The difference begins with the first look.

Tronto calls attentiveness "a suspension of one's self-interest, and a capacity genuinely to look from the perspective of the one in need." The opposite is what she names *privileged irresponsibility*: the luxury of not noticing. "One of the great benefits of being in a position of superiority is that one need not exert conscious effort in maintaining that system. Such privileged irresponsibility usually takes the form of complete ignorance of a problem." Attentiveness is the discipline of refusing that luxury.

### Core ideas

- **Relationships first.** The relationship is the basic unit of care. Some situations make duties visible because of roles and dependencies.
- **Power must answer questions.** Decisions should be explainable and challengeable. If no one can question you, it isn't fair.
- **Be precise only when it helps.** Start with stories and people. Add numbers when they clarify; update them when reality changes.
- **Rights baseline.** We use the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights plus local constitutional rights. Claims that try to erase someone's basic standing are recorded but do not set the agenda.
- **Enoughness.** A good system knows its scope and can let go — a kami that tends a place and leaves when its work is done.

### Why this matters for alignment

Many AI plans try to "learn the objective" from old data. But shared goals are bargains among changing lives. When people who were ignored finally speak, the target moves. Guessing a perfect, fixed goal fails.

Attentiveness offers another route: align to a trusted process that listens, explains, adapts, and can be corrected. Summaries show their sources. Unknowns are explicit. Standing invitations to revise remain open when new voices appear.

Rule of thumb: *Bridge first, decide second.*

### What good attentiveness looks like

- **Hunt for absences.** "We heard nothing from night-shift carers — go find them." Missing voices are data.
- **Show your work.** Every summary links to sources and marks disagreements.
- **Share attention fairly.** Don't just follow the loudest. Give time to those most affected. Smaller, coherent clusters offer a higher bridging bonus because they are harder to bridge to.
- **Build in repair.** Sunset clauses, review points, reversible defaults, and the humility to shut down or hand off.

### From ideas to practice

1. **Listen widely.** Take input by voice, text, and simple forms. Keep original language next to translations. Offer offline and accessible options.
2. **Map the views.** Make a bridging map that shows where people agree, where they clash, and why — without forcing a fake average.
3. **Send receipts.** Tell contributors where their words appear. Let them correct mistakes.
4. **Set a fair queue.** Spend more time where harm is high and voices are quiet. Make the rules public.
5. **Decide with brakes.** Big changes need the map, the receipts, and an oversight check before they ship.

### Tools (buildable today)

- **Broad listening.** Multi-language, multi-channel input with source and uncertainty kept intact.
- **Bridging maps.** Charts of overlap and disagreement, with citations.
- **Perspective receipts.** Each person can find and correct how they were represented.
- **Machine-checkable rules.** Community data rules written so software can enforce them automatically.
- **Fair queues.** Simple algorithms that favour high-risk issues and quiet voices.

### Flood-bot story

A midsize city is hit by floods. The city launches a simple chatbot to help people apply for emergency cash.

- **Listening.** People send voice notes, texts, or visit a kiosk. Messages stay in the original language, with a clear translation beside them.
- **Mapping.** The team sorts needs into categories: housing, wage loss, medical care. They keep disagreements visible — renters and homeowners need different proofs.
- **Receipts.** Every contributor gets a link to see how their words were used and a button to say "that's not what I meant."
- **Fair queue.** Extra review time for medically fragile people and areas with poor connectivity.
- **Measure.** A public dashboard shows who was reached and how fair the queue was.

### What could go wrong

- **One metric runs the show.** Engagement is up, trust is down. Fix: use a small set of balanced measures and rotate them.
- **Listening theatre.** Glossy reports, same outcomes. Fix: real decision gates, outside veto power, spot-checks.
- **Loud voices take over.** Well-funded groups flood the channel. Fix: throttles, fair quotas, public attention dashboards.
- **First movers freeze the frame.** Early language locks in. Fix: rolling windows and boosts for late but important views.
- **False balance.** Treating harmful claims as equal. Fix: separate facts from values, uphold basic rights, refuse fake equivalence.
- **Fake crowds.** Copy-paste comments. Fix: source checks and rate limits.
- **Capture by power.** Fix: keep oversight independent, rulings public, funding transparent.

### Interfaces with other packs

- **To Responsibility (Pack 2):** attentiveness hands over the who, what, and why — along with flags on rights and unknowns.
- **To Competence (Pack 3):** high-caution areas become small, safe-to-fail trials.
- **To Responsiveness (Pack 4):** repair loops feed back; new needs restart the cycle.
- **To Solidarity (Pack 5):** fair attention and open challenge build cross-group trust.
- **To Symbiosis (Pack 6):** the system serves a place and time, and treats shutdown as success.

### A closing image: the hospitable threshold that can still say no

Picture a host who welcomes each guest by name, makes space for their baggage, and shows how their presence changes the seating plan. That is attentiveness. And because some guests try to erase others, the host keeps a firm rule: hospitality within a rights-respecting home. Teach our systems to be good hosts before great optimisers, and we will keep more of what is precious and create more that is shareable.

Your neighbour knocks: "The tree on your lot is cracking the shared wall." A responsible reply isn't "Thanks for the feedback," but asking: who will inspect, when, what they'll do if risk is high, how to appeal if the fix fails, and what you owe if a fix is late.

In sum, listening without acting is theatre. Acting without limits is arbitrary. Responsibility bridges the two by turning recognition into engagement with teeth — promises you can verify, contest, and revoke.

Tronto elevates responsibility as the most politically central phase of care. She reframes democratic politics itself: not "who gets what, when, and how" (Lasswell) but _"who is responsible for caring for what, when, where, and how."_

### Privileged irresponsibility

Why must responsibility be explicit? Because power defaults to evasion. Tronto identifies five structural "passes" that excuse people from caring:

1. **The protection pass.** Those who protect (military, security) claim exemption from other care.
1. **The production pass.** Those who earn claim exemption from household and community care.
1. **The taking-care-of-my-own pass.** Those who care intensely for their own children or group claim exemption from caring about others.
1. **The bootstrap pass.** "You should have arranged your own care through the market."
1. **The charity pass.** "Voluntary giving is enough; no collective obligation is needed."

These passes are the irresponsibility machine that civic AI must short-circuit. Engagement contracts exist to make passes visible and revocable.

### Core ideas

1. **Answerability is the unit.** If no answer is required, nobody is responsible.
1. **Authority must match duty.** No duty without the powers (budget, access, pause) to fulfil it.
1. **Promises over preferences.** Goodwill is fragile; verifiable commitments travel.
1. **Two lanes.** Big changes follow the full contract; small, safe-to-fail bets run in a sandbox with tighter bounds and quicker cycles.
1. **Institutional memory.** Making responsibilities fractal — mirrored from team to agency — ensures they survive leadership changes.

### The Engagement Contract (core artifact)

Every significant deployment carries a published Engagement Contract — a short, legible spec anyone can audit.

**Contents (one page if possible):**

1. **Purpose & non-purpose:** Needs we serve; what is out of scope.
1. **Inputs & outputs:** Data sources, transformations, retention; who sees what; deletion on handover.
1. **Rights & guardrails:** Rights baseline + local rights as the threshold for relational standing — rights we won't trade; red lines (e.g., no biometric expansion).
1. **Service levels.** Severity classes (S0 life/safety; S1 livelihood; S2 convenience; S3 UX) with response windows.
1. **Pause/rollback triggers.** Conditions, who can invoke (PO, oversight, quorum of affected people), and duration.
1. **Adopt-or-explain.** How we adopt Assembly outcomes or explain deviations with reasons and a remedy plan.
1. **Remedies.** Correction, rollback, compensation. Tiered by severity: escrowed funds for S0/S1; mutual insurance pools or automatic pause for lower-severity community deployments.
1. **Change log.** Version history with hash-chained diffs and rationales (tamper-evident).
1. **Contacts.** Accountable person(s), term, mandate, conflicts disclosed.

### Oversight with teeth

1. **Independent board** (community + domain + legal). Can pause or veto high-impact changes; must publish reasons and declare conflicts.
1. **Protected budget & terms.** Resists capture.
1. **Open docket.** Anyone can file a challenge; triage is public; decisions are reasoned.
1. **Clawbacks & penalties.** Breached promises trigger automatic remedies (escrow drawdown, withheld payment, probation).
1. **Public attestation.** Weekly contract state and diffs are digitally signed and mirrored to a public registry.

### From ideas to practice

1. **Translate recognition into a spec.** Convert attentiveness outputs into an Engagement Contract.
1. **Assign a Participation Officer (PO).** Task the PO with running the promise loop, tracking the ledger, and escalating.
1. **Wire brakes before launch.** Incorporate role-based pause/rollback buttons; test them.
1. **Pre-fund remedies.** Pre-fund escrow for compensation and rollback costs (S0/S1) and community deployments such as mutual insurance pools or automatic pause (S2/S3) — tier by impact, not organisational form.
1. **Tie payment to proof.** Keep vendor pay linked to promise delivery — SLA adherence and adopt-or-explain rate — not raw engagement.
1. **Run adopt-or-explain.** Integrate Assembly outputs or publish a reasoned deviation + remedy.
1. **Attest & publish.** Use independent audits to compare behaviour to contract; hash the diffs to a public mirror.
1. **Handover or shutdown.** Hand off with full records when scope ends — or trust breaks — or switch off gracefully.

### Flood-bot story: Part II

After the flood, the city's flood-bot must pay people on time and fix mistakes.

1. **Contract.** Contract promises S1 (livelihood) cases decided in 48h; pause if denials spike >25% in any district; rollback if appeals on a rule exceed 20%.
1. **Owner.** A named PO publishes the obligation ledger and signs weekly attestations.
1. **Adopt-or-explain.** The Assembly endorsed multiple proofs of residence. The team adopts three (utility bill, employer letter, neighbour attestations) and explains excluding bank statements (exclusion risk), offering a kiosk-notarized sworn statement as remedy.
1. **Pause.** Night-shift district shows 31% denials in 24h — Elena's claim among them, rejected for lacking a paper lease. The oversight board hits pause; the older "30-day proof" rule rolls back; emergency disbursements use a reversible default.
1. **Remedies.** Wrongly denied claims get automatic compensation (late fee + apology + fast-track). Escrow funds claims the same day.
1. **Handover clause.** The contract stipulates a strict six-week sunset and handover: records and models transfer to the housing office; the switch-off is logged; the ledger is archived. The terms are now set. Execution comes when the clock runs out.

### What could go wrong

1. **Scope creep.** Bot starts "screening fraud" unrelated to relief. Fix: Enforce outer bounds; require fresh authority for scope changes.
1. **Responsibility ping-pong.** Teams blame each other. Fix: Single named owner per promise; PO escalates stalled dependencies.
1. **Paper commitments.** PDFs with no force. Fix: Escrow, clawbacks, attestation and audit triggers wired before launch.
1. **Unfunded mandates.** Duties without budget. Fix: Block go-live unless authority and funding match duty.
1. **Quiet rollbacks.** Rules change without notice. Fix: Mandatory public diffs; unlogged changes are invalid.
1. **Escrow gates out the grassroots.** Only well-funded actors can post bonds, re-centralising AI. Fix: Tier liability by severity; mutual insurance for community deployments; pause triggers replace escrow where financial stakes are low.

### Interfaces with other packs

1. **From Attentiveness (Pack 1):** who/what/why arrives with rights flags and uncertainties.
1. **To Competence (Pack 3):** responsibility turns needs into specs, SLAs, and brakes — safe-to-fail by default.
1. **To Responsiveness (Pack 4):** remedies, rollbacks, and evals are routine; repair is part of delivery.
1. **To Solidarity (Pack 5):** portability and exit rights (detailed in Pack 5) are referenced in every contract.
1. **To Symbiosis (Pack 6):** bounded scopes, handover, and shutdown are success criteria.

### A closing image: the signed work order

Picture a work order by the door: what will be fixed, by whom, by when; how to check the work; who to call if it fails. The signature is legible — and so is the penalty for not showing up. In other words, teach our systems to post their work orders, sign them, and honour them.
